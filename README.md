# **Malware-Detector** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91842166/172726791-f2dc3662-8c6b-491b-9a49-ac03401c6719.png" align="right" width="300px">
The Malware-Detector is a malicious PE files detector using different machine learning algorithms. For the realization of this project a series of steps have been followed, from getting a dataset with samples of malware to train and test the algorithms, to the realization of the web server.
Next when cloned the repository, you can select to use one or both options:
- **Jupyter Notebook**: You can increase or decrease the size of the dataset, taking into account the hardware used. And after training and testing the algorithms.
- **Web server**: You can display the web server developed with the framework Flask in Python.

## **Dataset choice**
First the Ember dataset has been used to perform training and testing of the machine learning algorithms used in the project.

In particular, in the working folder, the files provided for the year 2018 have been used
```
wget "https://ember.elastic.co/ember_dataset_2018_2.tar.bz2"
```
Then, extract files
```
tar -xf ember_dataset_2018_2.tar.bz2 -C [/path/to/working/folder]
```
These files have been trimmed later to be easily handled.

## **Workspace**
The workspace used is thefollowing:
- **Python version** &rarr; Python 3.9.7
- **Software used** &rarr; Visual Studio Code

## **Jupyter Notebook Installation**
First, in the working directory, the repository is cloned:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jorge-Tejero-Fdez/Malware-Analyzer.git
```
Then, all the requirements and all the necessary from Ember can be installed executed the jupyter notebook. <br />You have to consider the comments in the Notebook, because you can change thing like the size of the dataset. <br/> In particular, of the dataset, we use:
- TRAINING &rarr; 180.000 samples.
- TESTING &rarr; 30.000 samples.


## **Web Server Installation**
If not executed the markdown cell where the requirements are installed
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And go to the main folder and run the web server
```
python3 main.py
```
you can access the server from the browser by entering in the URL:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
