# **Malware-Detector** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91842166/172726791-f2dc3662-8c6b-491b-9a49-ac03401c6719.png" align="right" width="300px">
The Malware-Detector is a malicious PE files detector using different machine learning algorithms. For the realization of this project a series of steps have been followed, from getting a dataset with samples of malware to train and test the algorithms, to the realization of the web server.

## **Dataset choice**
First the Ember dataset has been used to perform training and testing of the machine learning algorithms used in the project. 
<p align="center">https://github.com/elastic/ember</p> 

In particular, in the working folder, the files provided for the year 2018 have been used
```
wget "https://ember.elastic.co/ember_dataset_2018_2.tar.bz2"
```
Then, extract files
```
tar -xf ember_dataset_2018_2.tar.bz2 -C [/path/to/working/folder]
```
These files have been trimmed later to be easily handled.

## **Workspace**
The workspace used is thefollowing:
- **Python version** &rarr; Python 3.9.7
- **Software used** &rarr; Visual Studio Code

## **Jupyter Notebook Installation**
First, in the working directory, the repository is cloned:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jorge-Tejero-Fdez/Malware-Analyzer.git
```
Then, all the requirements and all the necessary from Ember can be installed executed the jupyter notebook.

## **Web Server Installation**
If not executed the markdown cell where the requirements are installed
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And go to the main folder and run the web server
```
python3 main.py
```
you can access the server from the browser by entering in the URL:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
